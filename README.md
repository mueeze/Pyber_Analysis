# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

> The purpose of this analysis is to identify the disparities in fares in different city settings. It is to determine if location has any impact on Ride fares received by the drivers. Also to see is there is any seasonality.

## Results

> The data was analyzed in three different settings
    - Urban
    - Suburban
    - Rural
> These locations do play a significant role in identifying average ride fare and average fare per driver. Due to limited number of drivers available in the rural areas the demand for rides and availability of drivers lead to a higher average fare per driver. We also see that the average fare per ride is also high. This could be due to the distance covered due to the rural landscape. The trend goes downwards as we move from suburban to urban where we see a high number of drivers available and due to that average fare per driver is really low compared to other areas. People tend to use rides more often in the urban areas than the rural areas. 

## Summary

> Recommendations based on the analysis
    - Distribute drivers more in the suburban and rural areas as there is scope for growth.
    - Identify trip lengths and fare calculation for Urban areas to understand the difference in average fare per driver.
    - Conduct an analysis on seasonality in terms of days and times in the week where most rides are requested.
